# User Verification - Simplified (No WhatsApp)

## ✅ What Was Changed

### WhatsApp Verification Removed
As requested, I've removed all WhatsApp number verification from the user verification process. This will be added back in a later stage.

## 📋 Current Implementation

### Simple Flow:
1. **User uploads**: Profile picture + CNIC image
2. **System creates**: Verification request (status: "pending")
3. **Admin reviews**: Both images
4. **Admin approves/rejects**: With notes
5. **User gets**: Verification badge (or rejection reason)

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Request User Verification
```bash
POST /api/moderation/verifications/request_user_verification/
{
  "profile_image": "cloudinary_url_or_upload",
  "cnic_image": "cloudinary_url_or_upload"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Verification request submitted. Admin will review your profile and CNIC images.",
  "created_at": "2025-10-12T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Admin Approve
```bash
POST /api/moderation/verifications/{id}/approve/
{
  "notes": "All documents verified"
}
```

### Admin Reject
```bash
POST /api/moderation/verifications/{id}/reject/
{
  "notes": "CNIC image is not clear, please reupload"
}
```

## 📝 Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `backend/moderation/views.py` | ✅ Simplified `request_user_verification()` - now only accepts profile_image and cnic_image |
| `backend/moderation/serializers.py` | ✅ Removed WhatsApp fields from serializer |
| `backend/moderation/USER_VERIFICATION.md` | ✅ Updated documentation (renamed from WHATSAPP_VERIFICATION.md) |

## 🗑️ What Was Removed

- ❌ WhatsApp number requirement
- ❌ OTP generation
- ❌ `verify_whatsapp()` endpoint
- ❌ WhatsApp link generation from API response
- ❌ All WhatsApp-related complexity

## 💾 What Stayed in Database

The `VerificationRequest` model still has WhatsApp fields (for future use):
- `whatsapp_number` (nullable)
- `whatsapp_verified` (default: False)
- `otp` (nullable)
- `otp_created_at` (nullable)

These are **not used** currently but remain in the database for when you want to add WhatsApp verification back later.

## 🎯 Current MVP Focus

As per your roadmap:

✅ **User Registration**:
- Profile picture upload ✅
- CNIC picture upload ✅
- Admin review ✅

❌ **Not Included (For Now)**:
- WhatsApp number verification ❌ (will be added later)

## 🚀 How to Test

```bash
# 1. Start Django
cd backend
python manage.py runserver

# 2. Create verification request
POST /api/moderation/verifications/request_user_verification/
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
{
  "profile_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  "cnic_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/..."
}

# 3. Admin approves
POST /api/moderation/verifications/1/approve/
Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN
{
  "notes": "Verified successfully"
}

# 4. Check user's verification_status
GET /api/users/profile/
# user.verification_status should now be True
```

## 📱 Frontend Integration

```javascript
// 1. Upload images to Cloudinary first
const profileUrl = await uploadToCloudinary(profileFile);
const cnicUrl = await uploadToCloudinary(cnicFile);

// 2. Request verification
const response = await fetch('/api/moderation/verifications/request_user_verification/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    profile_image: profileUrl,
    cnic_image: cnicUrl
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
// Show success: "Your verification is under review"
```

## 🔮 Adding WhatsApp Back Later

When ready, you can easily add WhatsApp verification by:

1. Adding `whatsapp_number` to the API request
2. Generating OTP and wa.me link
3. User sends OTP manually via WhatsApp
4. User enters OTP to verify
5. Admin reviews profile + CNIC + verified WhatsApp number

The database fields and model methods are already there, just commented out in the views.

## ✅ What You Have Now

**Simple, clean user verification:**
- Upload profile picture
- Upload CNIC
- Submit for review
- Admin approves/rejects
- User gets verified badge

**No complexity. No WhatsApp. Ready for MVP.**

## 📚 Documentation

See `backend/moderation/USER_VERIFICATION.md` for complete documentation including:
- Detailed API examples
- Frontend integration code
- Security considerations
- Production recommendations

---

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for Development**

Your user verification is now simplified to just profile + CNIC review. WhatsApp verification removed as requested and can be added back anytime.
